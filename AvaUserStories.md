Clifford Turner use case

Epic
As Clifford Turner, a great salesperson and consultant with an Android phone (and websites)
I want an app I can use to
so I can show taxability

Story
- Login screen w/un and pw
- Incorporating the SDK (add Avalara SDK) and set up connection
- Display screen / taxability + rate
- Dropdown box w/list of product types (tax codes) / ie clothing, candy bars, sushi, furnace installation
- Box for postal code
- Execute transaction via AvaTax / Has to be a sales order. You don’t want to accidentally file taxes.

Stretch Goals
- Company selector
- Create a new demo company button / might want to see the nexus rules in every location
- Type ahead auto-complete / would be great to have things “filter” by what user is typing
- Change the amount of sale / there are some states that the dollar amount of an item affects it’s tax rate
    - Can think about quantity… there are a small number of places that the number of items you buy affect it’s tax rate
- Support for zip + 4
- Support for full addresses
