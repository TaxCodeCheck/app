#Team Agreement

##Conflic Resolution
1. Discussion first.
2. Internal Vote.
3. If an interal vote does not resolve the issue, go to the TA's or instructor.
4. Most importantly, make sure that each voice is heard.

##Working Hours
1. 9 - 6 daily. 

##Planning
We'll create and manage task list using **GitHub kanban** and coding. 

We also need to agree on MVP and user scenario.

##Daily Programming
1. Check in every morning. 
2. We'll pair program as needed.

##GitHub/ Merge Process
1. After scaffolding is built, primary will be protected and only production branch can be merged to. 
2. Notify everyone when any one is doing pull requests.
3. Have others review/approve pull requests.
4. Notify team about merges so team is ready and aware. 
2. Each task will have it's own branch and be named as such, for example "day-task-name". No one can approve their own pull requests. 

##Goals
1. MVP by 5:00PM Wednesday.
2. Stretch on Thursday along with design.
3. Friday morning practice presentation.
